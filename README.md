Dude, just walked out of Cleaner and my brain feels like it’s been through a dryer cycle. Still smell the popcorn, sticky on my fingers. You know that feeling when you’re watching rain sliding down windows, and it’s all too much but you can’t stop? That. 

The theater was all buzzing, people shuffling, someone’s phone light in my face. But then, the opening credits — sharp like biting into a lemon, and I was hooked. There’s a scene with a mop, yes a mop, but it feels like an opera. I was thinking about that as some kid behind me kicked my seat for like the fifth time — god, my back, it’s ancient. Why are seats so uncomfortable? Design failure. 

> Mos def need to download the movie again. Try watching it alone — I reckon no distractions, just that eerie score dripping into your room like fog. Wait, did Ray actually clean anything, or was it just his mind? Sort of like when you binge on celery but still feel full. Strange but satisfying. Midway, a cat crossed the screen, and it wasn’t even night — some symbolism about life demands? Or cats are just everywhere?

Anyway, I was too busy trying to untangle the red herrings like a heap of mismatched socks. This scene when Ray stares into his own reflection, half like he’s about to battle an alien, half like me staring at expiration dates in the grocery store. There was someone munching loudly, adding a layer of real-life soundtrack, beneath the movie’s whispers.

Someone said to watch the movie because it’s ‘deep’ but I don’t know man, maybe just drown in it more, cos it’s the little glimpses of humanity, like errant popcorn kernels in your drink, that stay with you.

Got to the end and I felt like someone had juggled my neurons. The credits rolled up — my mind was still catching up, de-fragging. I need one more viewing. One more go to actually decide on anything. Movies like this — they twist in you, like a riddle you didn’t ask for but need to answer now.

Wait, I had a pen in my pocket, where’s it gone? There was this thing with the janitor’s closet, absolutely wrenching. And oh! Did I leave a packet of chips in there cuz my seat smells funny.
